# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security vulnerability is identified in TicTaaC please
open an [issue](https://github.com/rusakovichma/TicTaaC/issues/new/choose)
and/or submit a PR to resolve the identified vulnerability.

The team is very responsive to reported vulnerabilities - reported issues must be resolved in 30 days or less.

Note - there are several vulnerable test dependencies and test resources. These are never executed or included in a release; these vulnerable resources are present so that the functionality of TicTaaC can be tested.
