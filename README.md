Lightweight and easy-to-use Threat modeling solution following DevSecOps principles

## Preface
"One day the customer asked to perform threat modeling for our product. Of course, we have heard about it a lot
from different teams, I have even read several articles and looked through a book to get familiar with this process,
but they were too abstract as for me and didn't give me a certainty at all. Then we have faced several enterprise - level 
products which theoretically would help us, but we didn't want to deploy the whole security program because of it, 
we just waned to get the threats list for our product. Nothing else"

## Idea
The idea behind this product is clear - I want to create something simple that would help to solve this difficult problem.
Ideally, with <em>one click</em> or <em>a command</em> and with a possibility to integrate it into a pipeline if needed. Inspired by <em>dependency-check</em> architecture and simplicity plus taking in mind that <em>developers just love mapping</em> everything in code, I've created <strong>"TicTaaC"</strong>, which means <em>"Threat modeling-as-a-Code in a Tick"</em>
