TicTaaC (Threat-Modeling-as-a-Code in a Tick) solution may be used to identify threats
related to an application architecture, design and development process.
Core will automatically generate threats classified by Microsoft STRIDE and OWASP Top 10
according to the provided data flow diagram file described in a special lightweight format.

 --threatModel <file>                       (Mandatory) Data flow diagram file to process.
 --out <file>                               (Optional) The folder to write report to.
                                            This defaults to the current directory.
 --outFormat <format>                       (Optional) The report format (HTML, JSON).
                                            The default is HTML.
 --mitigations <file>                       (Optional) The file with the mitigation
                                            strategy for the corresponding threats from
                                            the report.
 --failOnThreatRisk <score>                 (Optional) Specifies if the build should be
                                            failed if a Threat Risk above a specified

                                            By default the build will never fail.
 --threatsLibrary <path>                    (Optional) The path to the file with the rules
                                            containing threat-generating logic. It may be
