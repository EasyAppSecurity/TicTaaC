rules:
  - information-discosure-in-transit
    title: Information Disclosure and Tampering in Transit for {flow.name}
    severity: High
    categories: information-disclosure, tampering
    expression: (flow.encryption == no) or (flow.encryption == undefined)
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In network eavesdropping attacks, hackers look for weak connections between clients and servers. By exploiting these weak connections, hackers intercept data packets traversing the network. Any network, web or email traffic, if not encrypted, can be read by the hacker.
    remediation: Ensure strong TLS is configured for the {flow.name} connection

    expression: (target.type == database) and ((target.storedAssets contain sensitive) or (target.storedAssets contain undefined))
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case if an attacker can access lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned hardware, or copy the entire filesystem from the server and run it on its own hardware, as a result the sensitive assets stored in {target.name} will be compromised
    remediation: 1. Ensure sensitive information is encrypted at rest level in {target.name} using recommended algorithms 2. Ensure encryption keys are properly protected (for example, stored at Vault)

    description: In case if broad product development team has unrestricted access to the production environment, the chances of sensitive information disclosure or the whole system compromise are increasing
    remediation: 1. Ensure only limited number of trusted employees has access to the production environment 2. Consider transfering the production support to the special dedicated team 3. Consider usage of the solutions like Bastion Hosts and privilege access management systems for the production env access

  - anonymous-access
    title: Anonymous access to {target.name}
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing, information-disclosure
    expression: (flow.authenticationMethod == anonymous) or (flow.authenticationMethod == undefined)
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case of if anonymous access to {target.name} is enabled, a potential attacker can gather additional information about the target using this public-available source
    remediation: 1. Enumerate all the publicly-accessible entrypoints on {target.name} 2. Consider access-control protection for the entrypoints with unwanted anonymous access

  - weak-authentication-method
    title: Weak authentication method for {target.name} access
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing
    expression: flow.authenticationMethod == undefined
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case of of weak authentication for {target.name} connection, a potential attacker can easily spoof another users identity or gain access to any accounts credentials
    remediation: Consider usage of strong authentication method for {target.name} access (OpenID, Kerberos, etc)

  - ntlm-protocol-usage
    title: NTLM protocol usage for {target.name} access
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing
    expression: flow.authenticationMethod == ntlm
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: The challenge with having NTLM in your network is that it is easily exploitable and puts an organization at risk for a breach
    remediation: 1. Ensure LM and NTLMv1 are disabled completely, allowing only the safer NTLMv2 (at least it mitigates some of the replay attacks) or use Kerberos if it is possible 2. If you cant disable the protocol, start with auditing all NTLM traffic, followed by analysis of servers and users that use NTLM, and ultimately determining which uses can be abandoned and which should be set as an exception after restricting NTLM

  - credentials-brute-force
    title: {target.name} credentials brute-force
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing
    expression: (flow.authenticationMethod == credentials) or (flow.authenticationMethod == basic)

  - default-account-disabling
    title: {target.name} default account disabling
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing, elevation-of-privilege
    expression: target.type == database
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: A default account for {target.name} (for example, admin, root, sa, postgre, etc) may be used by an attacker to gain access to the information and assets stored in the storage
    remediation: Ensure the default account is not used or disabled/locked-out on {target.name} side

  - admin-access-hijacking
    title: {target.name} administrative access hijacking
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing, elevation-of-privilege
    expression: flow.authorization == admin
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case if potential attacker can hijack administrative account to {target.name} or compromise it, he will gain an unlimited access to {target.name} data and functional assets
    remediation: 1. Consider protection of administrative accounts with MFA on {target.name} side if it is possible 2. Consider administrative account lockout, replacement by least-privilege account or permissions limitation

  - excessive-permissions
    title: {target.name} access with excessive permissions
    severity: High
    categories: elevation-of-privilege
    expression: (flow.authorization == admin) or (flow.authorization == readWrite)
    exclude: (flow.inScope == false) or (source.type == proxyServer) or (target.type == proxyServer)
    description: If {source.name} has excessive permissions (admin, root, etc) for {target.name} connection, in case of {source.name} compromise, a potential attacker can gain access to an extra permissions on {target.name}
