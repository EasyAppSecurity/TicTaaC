name: Default Threats Library
version: 1.0.0

rules:
  - information-discosure-in-transit
    title: Information Disclosure and Tampering in Transit for {flow.name}
    severity: High
    categories: information-disclosure, tampering
    expression: (flow.encryption == no) or (flow.encryption == undefined)
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In network eavesdropping attacks, hackers look for weak connections between clients and servers. By exploiting these weak connections, hackers intercept data packets traversing the network. Any network, web or email traffic, if not encrypted, can be read by the hacker.
    remediation: Ensure strong TLS is configured for the {flow.name} connection

  - information-discosure-at-rest
    title: Information Disclosure and Tampering at Rest for {target.name}
    severity: High
    categories: information-disclosure, tampering
    expression: (target.type == database) and ((target.storedAssets contain sensitive) or (target.storedAssets contain undefined))
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case if an attacker can access lost, stolen, or inappropriately decommissioned hardware, the sensitive assets stored in {target.name} will be compromised
    remediation: 1. Ensure sensitive information is encrypted at rest level in {target.name} using recommended algorithms 2. Ensure encryption keys are properly protected (for example, stored at Vault)

  - anonymous-access
    title: Anonymous access to {target.name}
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing, information-disclosure
    expression: (flow.authenticationMethod == anonymous) or (flow.authenticationMethod == undefined)
    exclude: flow.inScope == false
    description: In case of if anonymous access to {target.name} is enabled, a potential attacker can gather additional information about the target using this public-available source
    remediation: 1. Enumerate all the publicly-accessible entrypoints on {target.name} 2. Consider access-control protection for the entrypoints with unwanted anonymous access

  - local-account-management
    title: Local account management on {target.name}
    severity: High
    categories: spoofing, elevation-of-privilege
    expression: flow.accountManagement == localAccount
    exclude: (flow.inScope == false) or (source within demilitarized-zone) or (source within closed-perimeter)
    description: In case of inappropriate account management on {target.name} side (for example, if account credentials are stored at {target.name} configuration file), it can lead to weak password complexity or rotation issues, that can be used by an attacker to brute force the credentials or for accounts enumeration
    remediation: Consider transferring the responsibility of account management to centralized SSO or Identity and Access Management system
